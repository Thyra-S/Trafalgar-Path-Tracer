# Ray Tracing
A from-scratch, C++ physically-based ray tracer built to simulate realistic lighting, materials, and shadows.

## ✨ Features

*   **Primitives:** Spheres, Planes, and Triangles/Meshes.
*   **Materials:** 
    *   *Diffuse (Matte):* Scatters light randomly.
    *   *Metal (Reflective):* Perfectly reflective or slightly fuzzy reflections.
    *   *Dielectric (Glass):* Refraction and reflection based on Snell's law and Schlick's approximation.
*   **Lighting:** Point lights, directional lights, and soft shadows.
*   **MIS:** Multiple Importance Sampling with Probability Distribution Functions for direct light sampling (shadow rays/Next Event Estimation)
*   **Anti-Aliasing:** Multiple samples standard AA for smooth edges.
*   **Camera:** Positionable virtual camera with adjustable Field of View (FOV) and Depth of Field (Defocus Blur).
*   **Output:** Generates standard `.ppm` image files, use ImageMagick to convert to other formats.
*   **.obj File Loading:** Imports .obj files using simple OBJ loader, with valid normal mapping and uv mapping.
*   **Multithreading:** Dynamically allocates different ray calculations to different threads
*   **BVH:** Simple Binary BVH creation using Binned SAH, with longest axis as a fallback.
